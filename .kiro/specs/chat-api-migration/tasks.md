# Implementation Plan (Parked)

This feature is parked: the repository has no Prompt Section Visualizer code or migration work. If revived, create a fresh plan aligned to the then-current chat APIs and UX.

- [ ] 0. Re-evaluate scope and feasibility  
  - Confirm whether a Prompt Section Visualizer is still required.  
  - Reassess the API surface and desired UX (native chat vs. webview).  
  - Draft new design/requirements before coding.  

All prior migration tasks are obsolete and were removed with the underlying code. No active work is planned.
