# Standalone Renderer Sub-Spec

Use this folder to track the renderer-unification follow-up for the Prompt Section Visualizer.

## Files
- `plan.md` – work plan + acceptance gates for merging the inline chat renderer with the standalone panel.

## Workflow
1. Read `.kiro/system-prompt.md` to stay aligned with spec-first expectations.
2. Update `plan.md` (or add new docs here) before touching source files.
3. When work ships, summarize in the parent `tasks.md` or add a new summary doc referencing this folder.

This keeps standalone renderer discussions isolated from the broader prompt visualizer spec while preserving traceability.
