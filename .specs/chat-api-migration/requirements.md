# Requirements Document (Parked)

## Introduction

The proposed migration of a Prompt Section Visualizer to VS Code's native Copilot Chat rendering APIs has not started and no related code exists in this repository. This feature is **parked** until a new mandate appears.

## Current Reality

- No Prompt Section Visualizer implementation is present in the repo.
- No migration work, flags, commands, or renderers exist.
- The Copilot Chat experience is unaffected by this spec.

## Requirements (Deferred)

All previous requirements for chat rendering, actions, editing, hybrid modes, and documentation are deferred. If the feature is revived, new requirements should be drafted against the then-current chat APIs and UX.
